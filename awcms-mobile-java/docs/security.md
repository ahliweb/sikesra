# Security Guidelines

## Storage

- Store access/refresh tokens in `EncryptedSharedPreferences` or Keystore.
- Do not store secret keys on device.
- Clear tokens on logout or token revocation.

## Transport

- Enforce HTTPS only (`usesCleartextTraffic=false`).
- Consider certificate pinning for production.
- Use timeouts and retry policies to avoid leaking retries.

## Auth and RLS

- Always use user access tokens for API calls.
- Rely on Supabase RLS to enforce tenant boundaries.
- Use server-side edge logic for privileged workflows.

## Permissions

- Request runtime permissions only when needed.
- Avoid broad permissions (location, storage) unless required.

## OWASP Mobile Basics

- Obfuscate release builds with R8/ProGuard.
- Disable logging of secrets in production.
- Detect tampering/rooted devices if required by policy.
- Use secure random for IDs and tokens.
